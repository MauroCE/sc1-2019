# Statistical Computing 1 Website

## Private building and viewing

Since the repository is currently private, the site is not built automatically with each commit.

To build it locally, open the `sc1-2019` project in RStudio and run

```
blogdown::serve_site()
```

You may need to install several packages to build the site the first time. You can view the site using a web browser, by pointing it to the local address generated by the command above. Usually this is something like http://127.0.0.1:4321/sc1-2019/

The site will be rebuilt every time a file is saved, so you do not need to rebuild it constantly.

## Public building and viewing

Once the materials are public, the site will be generated automatically like

https://awllee.github.io/blogdown-test/

You may notice that the public site will also have comments enabled, which are tracked via GitHub issues.
