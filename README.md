# Statistical Computing 1 Website

Since the repository is currently private, the site is not built automatically with each commit.

To build it locally, open the `sc1-2019` project in RStudio and run

```
blogdown::serve_site()
```

You may need to install several packages to build the site the first time.

The site will be rebuilt every time a file is saved, so you do not need to rebuild it constantly.
