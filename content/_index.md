# Statistical Computing 1

## Unit description

This unit introduces statistical computing. The basic concepts and typical workflows of statistical software development are exemplified using state-of-the art tools with R as the primary programming language. Students will be introduced to literate programming, package development, version control and testing. Basic scientific programming concepts will be covered, such as vectorization, functional and object-oriented programming. Some data science packages in the tidyverse will be introduced to enable data manipulation and visualization. The use of important statistical tools will be covered, such as sparse matrix algebra, numerical optimization and numerical integration.

## Intended learning outcomes

By the end of the unit students should be able to:

- Set up and work productively within an integrated development environment.
- Use collaborative tools for software development involving multiple people.
- Create and use R packages containing useful software for scientific research.
- Use some tidyverse functionality for data manipulation and visualization.
- Take advantage of matrix sparsity in scientific computations.
- Implement a solution to a data science problem using numerical optimization methods.
- Implement a solution to a data science problem using numerical integration methods.
